# ðŸŽ¯ Truth File Explorer Dashboard - Implementation Plan

## Overview
A self-generating dashboard that reads the truth file and creates an interactive visual map of the entire application architecture with clickable cross-references and impact analysis.

## Features to Implement

### Phase 1: Core Dashboard Structure
1. **Entity Overview Panel**
   - Count of fields, behaviors, permissions
   - Visual hierarchy of system vs user fields
   - Quick stats and health indicators

2. **Field Dependency Matrix**
   - Where each field is used across UI configurations
   - Impact analysis for field changes
   - Cross-reference clicking

3. **UI Configuration Visualizer**
   - Live previews of how configurations look
   - Color swatches for actual colors
   - Form/list/detail layout previews

4. **Workflow Flow Diagram**
   - Visual trigger â†’ condition â†’ action chains
   - Interactive workflow explorer

5. **Smart Analysis Engine**
   - Unused field detection
   - Missing reference warnings
   - Optimization suggestions

### Implementation Strategy
- Add new 'dashboard' view type to truth file
- Create TruthAnalyzer utility class
- Build interactive components using existing UI system
- Route: `/admin/truth`

### Technical Approach
- Meta-programming to analyze truth file structure
- Dependency graph generation
- Real-time validation and suggestions
- Visual impact simulation

## Expected Benefits
- Instant system understanding for new developers
- Configuration debugging and validation
- Change impact analysis before modifications
- Self-updating documentation that never gets stale
- Visual system architecture overview
