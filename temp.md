Excellent comprehensive analysis! Based on this deep scan, here are my additional
  strategic observations and suggestions:

  Critical Architecture Decisions Needed

  1. Database Strategy Clarification

  The codebase has a fundamental mismatch:
  - Documentation promises Turso (edge-distributed)
  - Implementation uses local SQLite
  - No migration path between them

  Suggestion: Decide on one approach and create an abstraction layer that can support
  both local development (SQLite) and production (Turso) with the same interface.

  2. Extension System Security Model

  The current extension system is too permissive:
  - Extensions get full database access
  - No sandboxing or permission boundaries
  - Extension loading uses dynamic imports without validation

  Suggestion: Design a capability-based security model where extensions declare needed
  permissions and get limited contexts.

  3. Truth File Validation Strategy

  Currently no validation of the truth file structure:
  - Malformed truth files cause runtime errors
  - No schema validation on startup
  - No migration strategy for truth file changes

  Suggestion: Implement a JSON Schema or Zod-based validation system that validates
  truth files on load and provides clear error messages.

  Missing Production Concerns

  1. State Management

  No consideration for:
  - Database migrations in production
  - Schema versioning
  - Backwards compatibility
  - Rollback strategies

  2. Observability

  Framework lacks:
  - Structured logging (currently just console.log)
  - Metrics collection
  - Health check endpoints beyond basic /health
  - Request tracing

  3. Configuration Management

  All configuration is hardcoded:
  - Database paths
  - Server ports
  - Environment-specific settings

  Developer Experience Gaps

  1. Truth File Authoring

  No tooling for:
  - Truth file validation during development
  - Auto-completion/IntelliSense support
  - Truth file debugging/inspection tools

  2. Extension Development

  Missing:
  - Extension scaffolding tools
  - Extension testing framework
  - Extension debugging capabilities
  - Extension marketplace/registry

  Design Pattern Inconsistencies

  1. Generator Pattern

  Some generators follow patterns, others don't:
  - API generator uses class-based approach
  - UI generator mixes static methods and classes
  - Dashboard generator is purely functional

  Suggestion: Standardize on a consistent generator interface.

  2. Error Handling Philosophy

  Mix of approaches:
  - Some methods throw exceptions
  - Others return error objects
  - Some log and continue
  - Inconsistent error response formats

  Suggestion: Define a framework-wide error handling strategy.

  Strategic Recommendations

  Phase 1: Foundation Hardening (1-2 weeks)

  1. Fix the critical security issue with new Function()
  2. Implement truth file validation
  3. Standardize error handling patterns
  4. Complete the type system (remove any types)

  Phase 2: Production Readiness (2-3 weeks)

  1. Implement proper database abstraction layer
  2. Add structured logging and observability
  3. Create configuration management system
  4. Implement proper extension security model

  Phase 3: Developer Experience (2-3 weeks)

  1. Build CLI tools for truth file management
  2. Implement hot reload system
  3. Create extension development tools
  4. Add comprehensive testing framework

  Architectural Philosophy Questions

  1. Should this be compilation-based or runtime-based?
    - Current: Runtime generation (regenerates on every request)
    - Alternative: Compile-time generation (build step produces static assets)
  2. What's the target deployment model?
    - Edge functions (Deno Deploy, Cloudflare Workers)
    - Traditional servers (Docker containers)
    - Serverless (AWS Lambda, Vercel)
  3. What's the extension model philosophy?
    - Plugin architecture (extensions modify behavior)
    - Microservice architecture (extensions are separate services)
    - Hybrid approach

  The framework has solid bones but needs focused effort on the foundational issues
  before adding new features. The biggest risk is the security vulnerabilities - those
  need immediate attention.
